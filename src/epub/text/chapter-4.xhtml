			<p>“Why, yes, Maria!” I exclaimed, “the way <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Marsh bore up was just wonderful to see! Twelve miles in deep snow, heavy marching through thickets and scrub, over ditches and dykes, stumps and pitfalls, with never a word of complaint, as though it were a picnic! You’d never have dreamt she was just out of prison.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course,” said Maria, proudly, “that would be just like her. And where is she now, Ivan Ilitch?”</p>
			<p>“On the way to England, I guess.”</p>
			<p>I was back again in Red Petrograd after a brief stay in Finland. That little country was supposed to be the headquarters of the Russian counterrevolution, which meant that everyone who had a plan to overthrow the Bolsheviks (and there were almost as many plans as there were patriots) conspired with as much noise as possible to push it through to the detriment of everybody else’s. So tongues wagged fast and viciously, and any old cock-and-bull story about anybody else was readily believed, circulated, and shouted abroad. You got it published if you could, and if you couldn’t (the papers, after all, had to draw the line somewhere), then you printed it yourself in the form of a libellous pamphlet. I felt a good deal safer in Petrograd, where I was thrown entirely on my own resources, than in Helsingfors, where the appearance of a stranger in a café or restaurant in almost anybody’s company was sufficient to set the puppets of a rival faction in commotion, like an ant-nest when a stone is dropped on it.</p>
			<p>So I hid, stayed at a room in a private house, bought my own food or frequented insignificant restaurants, and was glad when I was given some money for expenses and could return to my friends Maria, Stepanovna, the Journalist, and others in Petrograd.</p>
			<p>“How did you get back here, Ivan Ilitch?”</p>
			<p>“Same old way, Maria. Black night. Frozen river. Deep snow. Everything around⁠—bushes, trees, meadows⁠—still and grey-blue in the starlight. Finnish patrols kept guard as before⁠—lent me a white sheet, too, to wrap myself up in. Sort of cloak of invisibility, like in the fairy tales. So while the Finns watched through the bushes, I shuffled across the river, looking like Caesar’s ghost.”</p>
			<p>Maria was fascinated. “And did nobody see you?”</p>
			<p>“Nobody, Maria. To make a good story I should have knocked at the door of the Red patrol and announced myself as the spirit of His Late Imperial Majesty, returned to wreak vengeance, shouldn’t I? But I didn’t. Instead of that I threw away the sheet and took a ticket to Petrograd. Very prosaic, wasn’t it? I’ll have some more tea, please.”</p>
			<p>I found a new atmosphere developing in the city which is proudly entitled the “Metropolis of the World Revolution.” Simultaneously with the increasing shortage of food and fuel and the growing embitterment of the masses, new tendencies were observable on the part of the ruling Communist Party. Roughly, these tendencies might be classed as political or administrative, social, and militarist.</p>
			<p>Politically, the Communist Party was being driven in view of popular discontent to tighten its control by every means on all branches of administrative activity in the country. Thus the people’s cooperative societies and trade unions were gradually being deprived of their liberties and independence, and the “boss” system under Communist bosses was being introduced. At the same time elections had to be strictly “controlled,” that is, manipulated in such a way that only Communists got elected.</p>
			<p>As an offset to this, it was evident the Communists were beginning to realize that political “soundness” (that is, public confession of the Communist creed) was a bad substitute for administrative ability. The premium on ignorance was being replaced by a premium on intelligence and training, and bourgeois “specialists” of every calling, subject to rigid Communist control, were being encouraged to resume their avocations or accept posts with remunerative pay under the Soviet Government. Only two conditions were required, namely, that the individual renounce all claim to former property and all participation in politics. These overtures were made particularly to members of the liberal professions, doctors, nurses, matrons, teachers, actors, and artists, but also to industrial and commercial experts, and even landlords who were trained agriculturists. Thus was established a compromise with the bourgeoisie.</p>
			<p>No people in the world are so capable of heroic and self-sacrificing labour for purely altruistic motives as a certain type of Russian. I remember in the summer of 1918, when the persecution of the intelligentsia was at its height, drawing attention in an official report to the remarkable fact of the large number of educated Russians who had heroically stuck to their posts and were struggling in the face of adversity to save at least something from the general wreck. Such individuals might be found at times even within the ranks of “the party,” but they cared little for the silly politics of Bolshevism and nothing whatever for the world revolution. Credit is due to the Communists at least to this extent, that they realized ultimately the value of such service to humanity, and, when they discovered it, encouraged it, especially if the credit for it accrued to themselves. The work done by heroic individuals of this type served largely to counterbalance the psychological effect of ever-increasing political and industrial slavery, and it has therefore been denounced as “treacherous” by some counterrevolutionary émigrés, and especially by those in whose eyes the alleviation of the bitter lot of the Russian people was a minor detail compared with the restoration of themselves to power.</p>
			<p>The third growing tendency, the militarist, was the most interesting, and, incidentally, to me the most embarrassing. The stimulus to build a mighty Red army for world-revolutionary purposes was accentuated by the pressing need of mobilizing forces to beat off the counterrevolutionary, or “White,” armies gathering on the outskirts of Russia, particularly in the south and east. The call for volunteers was a complete failure from the start, except in so far as people joined the Red army with the object of getting bigger rations until being sent to the front, and then deserting at the first opportunity. So mobilization orders increased in frequency and stringency and until I got some settled occupation I had to invent expedients to keep my passport papers up to date.</p>
			<p>My friends, the Finnish patrols, had furnished me with a renewed document better worded than the last and with a later date, so I left the old one in Finland and now keep it as a treasured relic. As a precautionary measure I changed my name to Joseph Krylenko. But the time was coming when even those employees of the Extraordinary Commission who were not indispensable might be subject to mobilization. The Tsarist police agents, of course, and Chinese and other foreign hirelings, who eavesdropped and spied in the factories and public places, were indispensable, but the staff of clerical employees, one of whom I purported to be, might be cut down. So I had somehow to get a document showing I was exempt from military service.</p>
			<p>It was Zorinsky who helped me out. I called him up the day after my return, eager to have news of Melnikoff. He asked me to come round to dinner and I deliberated with myself whether, having told him I expected to go to Moscow, I should let him know I had been to Finland. I decided to avoid the subject and say nothing at all.</p>
			<p>Zorinsky greeted me warmly. So did his wife. As we seated ourselves at the dinner-table I noticed there was still no lack of good food, though Elena Ivanovna, of course, complained.</p>
			<p>“Your health, Pavel Ivanitch,” exclaimed Zorinsky as usual; “glad to see you back. How are things over there?”</p>
			<p>“Over where?” I queried.</p>
			<p>“Why, in Finland, of course.”</p>
			<p>So he knew already! It was a good thing for me that I had devoted a deal of thought to the enigmatical personality of my companion. I could not make him out. Personally, I disliked him intensely, yet he had already been of considerable service and in any case I needed his assistance to effect Melnikoff’s release. On one occasion he had mentioned, in passing, that he knew Melnikoff’s friend Ivan Sergeievitch, so it had been my intention to question the latter on the subject while in Finland, but he was away and I had seen no one else to ask. The upshot of my deliberations was that I resolved to cultivate Zorinsky’s acquaintance for my own ends, but until I knew him better never to betray any true feelings of surprise, fear, or satisfaction.</p>
			<p>Disconcerted, therefore, as I was by his knowledge of my movements, I managed to divert my undeniable confusion into an expression of disgust.</p>
			<p>“Rotten,” I replied with a good deal of emphasis, and, incidentally, of truth. “Absolutely rotten. If people here think Finland is going to do anything against the Bolsheviks they are mistaken. I never in my life saw such a mess-up of factions and feuds.”</p>
			<p>“But is there plenty to eat there?” put in Elena Ivanovna, this being the sole subject that interested her.</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, there is plenty to eat,” and to her delight and envy I detailed a comprehensive list of delicacies unobtainable in Russia, even by the theatrical world.</p>
			<p>“It is a pity you did not let me put you across the bridge at Bielo’ostrof,” observed Zorinsky, referring to his offer to assist me in getting across the frontier.</p>
			<p>“Oh, it was all right,” I said. “I had to leave at a moment’s notice. It was a long and difficult walk, but not unpleasant.”</p>
			<p>“I could have put you across quite simply,” he said, “⁠—both of you.”</p>
			<p>“Who, ‘both of us’?”</p>
			<p>“Why, you and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Marsh, of course.”</p>
			<p>Phew! So he knew that, too!</p>
			<p>“You seem to know a lot of things,” I remarked, as casually as I could.</p>
			<p>“It is my hobby,” he replied, with his crooked, cynical smile. “You are to be congratulated, I must say, on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Marsh’s escape. It was, I believe, very neatly executed. You didn’t do it yourself, I suppose?”</p>
			<p>“No,” I said, “and, to tell the truth, I have no idea how it was done.” I was prepared to swear by all the gods that I knew nothing of the affair.</p>
			<p>“Nor have they any idea at <abbr>No.</abbr> 2 Gorokhovaya,” he said. “At least, so I am told.” He appeared not to attach importance to the matter. “By the way,” he continued a moment later, “I want to warn you against a fellow I have heard Marsh was in touch with. Alexei⁠—Alexei⁠—what’s his name?⁠—Alexei Fomitch something-or-other⁠—I’ve forgotten the surname.”</p>
			<p>The Policeman!</p>
			<p>“Ever met him?”</p>
			<p>“Never heard of him,” I said, indifferently.</p>
			<p>“Look out if you do,” said Zorinsky, “he is a German spy.”</p>
			<p>“Any idea where he lives?” I inquired, in the same tone.</p>
			<p>“No; he is registered under a pseudonym, of course. But he doesn’t interest me. I chanced to hear of him the other day and thought I would caution you.”</p>
			<p>Was it mere coincidence that Zorinsky mentioned the Policeman? I resolved to venture a query.</p>
			<p>“Any connection between <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Marsh and this⁠—er⁠—German spy?” I asked, casually.</p>
			<p>“Not that I know of.” For a moment a transitory flash appeared in his eyes. “You really think <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Marsh was ignorant of how she escaped?” he added.</p>
			<p>“I am positive. She hadn’t the faintest notion.”</p>
			<p>Zorinsky was thoughtful. We changed the subject, but after a while he approached it again.</p>
			<p>“It is impertinent of me to ask questions,” he said, courteously, “but I cannot help being abstractly interested in your chivalrous rescue of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Marsh. I scarcely expect you to answer, but I should, indeed, be interested to know how you learned she was free.”</p>
			<p>“Why, very simply,” I replied. “I met her quite by chance at a friend’s house and offered to escort her across the frontier.”</p>
			<p>Zorinsky collapsed and the subject was not mentioned again. Though it was clear he had somehow established a connection in his mind between the Policeman’s name and that of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Marsh, my relief was intense to find him now on the wrong tack and apparently indifferent to the subject.</p>
			<p>As on the occasion of my first visit to this interesting personage, I became so engrossed in subjects he introduced that I completely forgot Melnikoff, although the latter had been uppermost in my thoughts since I successfully landed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Marsh in Finland. Nor did the subject recur to mind until Zorinsky himself broached it.</p>
			<p>“Well, I have lots of news for you,” he said as we moved into the drawing-room for coffee. “In the first place, Vera Alexandrovna’s café is rounded up and she’s under lock and key.”</p>
			<p>He imparted this information in an indifferent tone.</p>
			<p>“Are you not sorry for Vera Alexandrovna?” I said.</p>
			<p>“Sorry? Why should one be? She was a nice girl, but foolish to keep a place like that, with all those stupid old fogeys babbling aloud like chatterboxes. It was bound to be found out.”</p>
			<p>I recalled that this was exactly what I had thought about the place myself.</p>
			<p>“What induced <em>you</em> to frequent it?” I asked.</p>
			<p>“Oh, just for company,” he replied. “Sometimes one found someone to talk to. Lucky I was not there. The Bolsheviks got quite a haul, I am told, something like twenty people. I just happened to miss, and should have walked right into the trap next day had I not chanced to find out just in time.”</p>
			<p>My misgivings, then, regarding Vera’s secret café had been correct, and I was thankful I had fought shy of the place after my one visit. But I felt very sorry for poor Vera Alexandrovna. I was still thinking of her when Zorinsky thrust a big blue sheet of oil paper into my hands.</p>
			<p>“What do you think of that?” he asked.</p>
			<p>The paper was a pen-sketch of the Finnish Gulf, but for some time I could make neither head nor tail of the geometrical designs which covered it. Only when I read in the corner the words “Fortress of Kronstadt, Distribution of Mines,” did I realize what the map really was.</p>
			<p>“Plan of the minefields around Kronstadt and in the Finnish Gulf,” explained Zorinsky. The mines lay in inner and outer fields and the course was shown which a vessel would have to take to pass through safely. The plan proved subsequently to be quite correct.</p>
			<p>“How did you get hold of it?” I asked, interested and amused.</p>
			<p>“Does it matter?” he said. “There is generally a way to do these things. That is the original. If you would like to make a copy of it, you must do so tonight. It must be returned to its locked drawer in the Admiralty not later than half-past nine tomorrow morning.”</p>
			<p>A few days later I secured through my regular Admiralty connections, whom I met at the Journalist’s, confirmation of this distribution of mines. They could not procure me the map, but they gave a list of the latitudes and longitudes, which tallied precisely with those shown on Zorinsky’s plan.</p>
			<p>While I was still examining the scheme of minefields my companion produced two further papers and asked me to glance at them. I found them to be official certificates of exemption from military service on the ground of heart trouble, filled up with details, date of examination (two days previously), signatures of the officiating doctor, who was known to me by name, the doctor’s assistant, and the proxy of the controlling commissar. One was filled out in the name of Zorinsky. The other was complete⁠—except for the name of the holder! A close examination and comparison of the signatures convinced me they were genuine. This was exactly the certificate I so much needed to avoid mobilization and I began to think Zorinsky a genius⁠—an evil genius, perhaps, but still a genius!</p>
			<p>“One for each of us,” he observed, laconically. “The doctor is a good friend of mine. I needed one for myself, so I thought I might as well get one for you, too. At the end of the day the doctor told the commissar’s assistant he had promised to examine two individuals delayed by business half an hour later. There was no need for the official to wait, he said; if he did not mind putting his signature to the empty paper, he assured him it would be all right. He knew exactly what was the trouble with the two fellows; they were genuine cases, but their names had slipped his memory. Of course, the commissar’s assistant might wait if he chose, but he assured him it was unnecessary. So the commissar’s assistant signed the papers and departed. Shortly after, the doctor’s assistant did the same. The doctor waited three-quarters of an hour for his two cases. They did not arrive, and here are the exemption certificates. Will you fill in your name at once?”</p>
			<p>What? <em>My name!</em> I suddenly recollected that I had never told Zorinsky what surname I was living under, nor shown him my papers, nor initiated him into any kind of personal confidence whatsoever. Nor had my reticence been accidental. At every house I frequented I was known by a different Christian name and patronymic (the Russian mode of address), and I felt intensely reluctant to disclose my assumed surname or show the passport in my possession.</p>
			<p>The situation was one of great delicacy, however. Could I decently refuse to inscribe my name in Zorinsky’s presence after the various favours he had shown me and the assistance he was lending me⁠—especially by procuring me the very exemption certificate I so badly needed? Clearly it would be an offence. On the other hand, I could not invent another name and thus lose the document, since it would always have to be shown together with a regular passport. To gain time for reflection I picked up the certificate to examine it again.</p>
			<p>The longer I thought the clearer I realized that, genuine though the certificate undoubtedly was, the plot had been laid deliberately to make me disclose the name under which I was living! Had it been the Journalist, or even the Policeman, I should not have hesitated, certainly not have winced as I did now. But it was Zorinsky, the clever, cynical, and mysterious Zorinsky, for whom I suddenly conceived, as I cast a sidelong glance at him, a most intense and overpowering repugnance.</p>
			<p>Zorinsky caught my sidelong glance. He was lolling in a rocking-chair, with a bland expression on his misformed face as he swung forward and backward, intent on his nails. He looked up, and as our eyes met for the merest instant I saw he had not failed to note my hesitation.</p>
			<p>I dropped into the desk-chair and seized a pen.</p>
			<p>“Certainly,” I said, “I will inscribe my name at once. This is, indeed, a godsend.”</p>
			<p>Zorinsky rose and stood at my side. “You must imitate the writing,” he said. “I am sorry I am not a draftsman to assist you.”</p>
			<p>I substituted a pencil for the pen and began to draw my name in outline, copying letters from the handwriting on the certificate. I rapidly detected the essentials of the handwriting, and Zorinsky applauded admiringly as I traced the words⁠—“Joseph Krylenko.” When they were done I finished them off in ink and laid down the pen, very satisfied.</p>
			<p>“Occupation?” queried my companion, as quietly as if he were asking the hour.</p>
			<p><em>Occupation!</em> A revolver-shot at my ear could not have startled me more than this simple but completely unexpected query! The two blank lines I took to be left for the name only, but, looking closer, I saw that the second was, indeed, intended for the holder’s business or occupation. The word <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">zaniatia</i> (occupation) was not printed in full, but abbreviated⁠—<i xml:lang="ru-Latn"><abbr>zan.</abbr></i>, while these three letters were concealed by the scrawling handwriting of the line below, denoting the age “thirty,” written out in full.</p>
			<p>I managed somehow not to jump out of my seat. “Is it essential?” I asked. “I have no occupation.”</p>
			<p>“Then you must invent one,” he replied. “You must have some sort of passport with you. What do you show the guards in the street? Copy whatever you have from that.”</p>
			<p>Cornered! I had put my foot in it nicely. Zorinsky was inquisitive for some reason or other to learn how I was living and under what name, and had succeeded effectually in discovering part at least of what he wanted to know. There was nothing for it. I reluctantly drew my passport of the Extraordinary Commission from my pocket in order that I might copy the exact wording.</p>
			<p>“May I see?” asked my companion, picking up the paper. I scrutinized his face as he slowly perused it. An amused smile flickered round his crooked mouth, one end of which jutted up into his cheek. “A very nice passport indeed,” he said, finally, looking with peculiar care at the signatures. “It will be a long time before you land in the cells of <abbr>No.</abbr> 2 Gorokhovaya if you continue like this.”</p>
			<p>He turned the paper over. Fortunately the regulation had not yet been published rendering all “documents of identification” invalid unless stamped by one’s house committee, showing the full address. So there was nothing on the back.</p>
			<p>“You are a pupil of Melnikoff, that is clear,” he said, laying the paper down on the desk. “By the way, I have something to tell you about Melnikoff. But finish your writing first.”</p>
			<p>I soon inscribed my occupation of clerk in an office of the Extraordinary Commission, adding also “six” to the age to conform with my other papers. As I traced the letters I tried to sum up the situation. Melnikoff, I hoped, would now soon be free, but misgivings began to arise regarding my own position, which I had a disquieting suspicion had in some way become jeopardized as a result of the disclosures I had had to make that evening to Zorinsky.</p>
			<p>When I had finished I folded the exemption certificate and put it with my passport in my pocket.</p>
			<p>“Well, what is the news of Melnikoff?” I said.</p>
			<p>Zorinsky was engrossed in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Pravda</i>, the official Press organ of the Communist Party. “I beg your pardon? Oh, yes⁠—Melnikoff. I have no doubt he will be released, but the investigator wants the whole 60,000 roubles first.”</p>
			<p>“That is strange,” I observed, surprised. “You told me he would only want the second half <em>after</em> Melnikoff’s release.”</p>
			<p>“True. But I suppose now he fears he won’t have time to get it, since he also will have to quit.”</p>
			<p>“And meanwhile what guarantee have I⁠—have we⁠—that the investigator will fulfil his pledge?”</p>
			<p>Zorinsky looked indifferently over the top of his newspaper.</p>
			<p>“Guarantee? None,” he replied, in his usual laconic manner.</p>
			<p>“Then why the devil should I throw away another 30,000 roubles on the off-chance⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“You needn’t if you don’t want to,” he put in, in the same tone.</p>
			<p>“Are you not interested in the subject?” I said, secretly indignant at his manner.</p>
			<p>“Of course I am. But what is the use of getting on one’s hind-legs about it? The investigator wants his money in advance. Without it, he will certainly risk nothing. With it, he may, and there’s an end of it. If I were you I would pay up, if you want Melnikoff let out. What is the good of losing your first 30,000 for nothing? You won’t get that back, anyway.”</p>
			<p>I thought for a moment. It seemed to me highly improbable that a rascal investigator, having got his money, would deliberately elect to put his neck in a noose to save someone he didn’t care two pins about. Was there no other means of effecting the escape? I thought of the Policeman. But with inquiries being made along one line, inquiries along a second would doubtless be detected by the first, with all sorts of undesirable complications and discoveries. An idea occurred to me.</p>
			<p>“Can we not threaten the life of the investigator if he plays false?” I suggested.</p>
			<p>Zorinsky considered. “You mean hire someone to shoot him? That would cost a lot of money and we should be in the hands of our hired assassin as much as we are now in those of our investigator, while if he were shot we should lose the last chance of saving Melnikoff. Besides, the day after we threaten the investigator’s life he will decamp with the first thirty thousand in his pocket. Pay up, Pavel Ivanitch, pay up and take the chance⁠—that’s my advice.”</p>
			<p>Zorinsky picked up his paper and went on reading.</p>
			<p>What should I do? Faint though the chance seemed, I resolved to take it, as it was the only one. I told Zorinsky I would bring him the money on the morrow.</p>
			<p>“All right,” he said, adding thoughtfully, as he laid aside the newspaper. “By the way, I think you were perhaps right about threatening the investigator’s life. Yes. It is not a bad idea. He need not know we know we are really powerless. We will tell him he is being tracked and cannot escape us. I will see what can be done about it. You are right, after all, Pavel Ivanitch.”</p>
			<p>Satisfied at having made this suggestion, I set about to copy the map of the minefields and then retired for the night.</p>
			<p>Not to sleep, however. For hours I paced up and down the soft carpet, recalling every word of the evening’s conversation, and trying to invent a means of making myself again independent of Zorinsky.</p>
			<p>Would Melnikoff be released? The prospects seemed suddenly to have diminished. Meanwhile, Zorinsky knew my name, and might, for all I knew, out of sheer curiosity, be designing to discover my haunts and acquaintances. I recalled poignantly how I had been cornered that evening and forced to show him my passport.</p>
			<p>With this train of thought I took my newly procured exemption certificate from my pocket and examined it again. Yes, it certainly was a treasure. “Incurable heart trouble”⁠—that meant permanent exemption. With this and my passport, I considered, I might with comparative safety even register myself and take regular rooms somewhere on the outskirts of the town. However, I resolved I would not do that as long as I could conveniently live in the centre of the city, moving about from house to house.</p>
			<p>The only thing I did not like about my new “document” was its patent newness. I have never yet seen anybody keep tidy “documents” in Russia, the normal condition of a passport being the verge of dissolution. There was no need to reduce my certificate to that state at once, since it was only two days old, but I decided that I would at least fold and crumple it as much as my passport, which was only five days old. I took the paper and, folding it tightly in four, pressed the creases firmly between finger and thumb. Then, laying it on the table, I squeezed the folds under my thumbnail, drawing the paper backward and forward. Finally, the creases looking no longer new, I began to ruffle the edges.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>And then a miracle occurred!</p>
			<p>You know, of course, the conundrum: “Why is paper money preferable to coin?”⁠—the answer being, “Because when you put it in your pocket you double it, and when you take it out you find it in creases.” Well, that is what literally did occur with my exemption certificate! While holding it in my hands and ruffling the edges, the paper all at once appeared to move of itself, and, rather like protozoa propagating its species, most suddenly and unexpectedly divided, revealing to my astonished eyes not one exemption certificate⁠—<em>but two</em>!</p>
			<p>Two of the printed sheets had by some means become so closely stuck together that it was only when the edges were ruffled that they fell apart, and neither the doctor nor Zorinsky had noted it. Here was the means of eluding Zorinsky by filling in another paper! How shall I describe my joy at the unlooked-for discovery! The nervous reaction was so intense that, much to my own amusement, I found tears streaming down my cheeks. I laughed and felt like the Count of Monte Cristo unearthing his treasure⁠—until, sobering down a little, I recollected that the blank form was quite useless until I had another passport to back it up.</p>
			<p>That night I thrashed out my position thoroughly and determined on a line of action. Zorinsky, I reflected, was a creature whom in ordinary life I should have been inclined to shun like the pest. I record here only those incidents and conversations which bear on my story, but when not discussing “business” he lavished a good deal of gratuitous information about his private life, particularly of regimental days, which was revolting. But in the abnormal circumstances in which I lived, to “cut” with anybody with whom I had once formed a close association was very difficult, and in Zorinsky’s case doubly so. Suppose he saw me in the street afterward, or heard of me through any of his numerous connections? Pursuing his “hobby” of <i xml:lang="fr">contre-espionnage</i> he would surely not fail to follow the movements of a star of the first magnitude like myself. There was no course open but to remain on good terms and profit to the full by the information I obtained from him and the people I occasionally met at his house⁠—information which proved to be invariably correct. But he must learn nothing of my other movements, and in this respect I felt the newly discovered blank exemption form would surely be of service. I had only to procure another passport from somewhere or other.</p>
			<p>What was Zorinsky’s real attitude toward Melnikoff, I wondered? How well had they known each other? If only I had some means of checking⁠—but I knew none of Melnikoff’s connections in Russia. He had lived at a hospital. He had spoken of a doctor friend. I had already twice seen the woman at the lodge to which he had directed me. I thought hard for a moment.</p>
			<p>Yes, good idea! On the morrow I would resort once more to Melnikoff’s hospital on The Islands, question the woman again, and, if possible, seek an interview with the doctor. Perhaps he could shed light on the matter. Thus deciding, I threw myself dressed on the bed and fell asleep.</p>
